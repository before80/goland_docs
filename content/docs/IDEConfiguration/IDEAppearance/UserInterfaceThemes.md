# User interface themes﻿

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/user-interface-themes.html

Last modified: 30 January 2023

The interface theme defines the appearance of windows, dialogs, buttons, and all visual elements of the user interface. By default, GoLand uses the Darcula theme, unless you changed it [during the first run](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/run-for-the-first-time.html).

> The interface theme is not the same as the [color scheme](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/configuring-colors-and-fonts.html), which defines the colors, fonts, and syntax-highlight for various text resources: the source code, search results, and so on.

### Change the UI theme﻿

1. In the Settings dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S), select Appearance & Behavior | Appearance.
2. Select the UI theme from the Theme list:
   - IntelliJ Light: Traditional light theme for IntelliJ-based IDEs
   - macOS Light or Windows 10 Light: OS-specific light theme available as a bundled plugin
   - Darcula: Default dark theme
   - High contrast: Theme designed for users with color vision deficiency

Select Sync with OS to let GoLand detect the current system settings and use the default dark or light theme accordingly.

It is also possible to create your own UI themes for GoLand and customize the built-in themes. For more information, see [IntelliJ Platform SDK Documentation](http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/ui_themes/themes_intro.html).

## Productivity tips﻿

### Use the quick switcher﻿

1. Press Ctrl+` or select View | Quick Switch Scheme form the menu.
2. In the Switch popup, select Theme, and then select the desired interface theme.

### Create shortcuts﻿

- You can map the Theme action to your [preferred key combination](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html).
