# Managing code coverage suites﻿

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/switching-between-code-coverage-suites.html

Last modified: 21 April 2023

GoLand provides a tool to select coverage suites for showing or hiding, adding, and removing suites.

### Select a coverage suite﻿

The list of coverage suites becomes available after you run at least one test with [coverage](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/running-test-with-coverage.html).

1. From the main menu, select Run | Show Coverage Data (Ctrl+Alt+F6).
2. Click Show selected. The dialog closes. In the editor, GoLand opens test coverage results for the selected test suites.
3. To hide the coverage results, select the checkboxes next to the necessary classes and click No Coverage.

### Upload or remove a coverage suite﻿

Consider a situation when a file that contains code coverage information has been obtained from the build server. You can load this file from the disk and examine it in GoLand. Also, you can open the coverage data that has been generated by the IDE some time ago.

1. From the main menu, select Run | Show Coverage Data (Ctrl+Alt+F6).

2. Click ![the Add button](ManagingCodeCoverageSuites_img/app.general.add.svg) and select the necessary **.ic** file in the dialog that opens.

   The files with coverage data generated by GoLand are saved to the **coverage** folder in the IDE [system directory](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/directories-used-by-the-ide-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs.html#system-directory) by default.

3. To remove a suite from the list and from the storage, select it in the list and click ![the Delete button](ManagingCodeCoverageSuites_img/app.general.remove.svg).
