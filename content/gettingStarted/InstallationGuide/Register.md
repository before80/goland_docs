   > GoLand detects the system proxy URL during initial startup and uses it for connecting to the JetBrains Account, Floating License Server, and License Vault. To override the URL of the system proxy, add the `-Djba.http.proxy` [JVM option](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/tuning-the-ide.html#configure-jvm-options). Specify the proxy URL as the host address and optional port number: `proxy-host[:proxy-port]`. For example: `-Djba.http.proxy=http://my-proxy.com:4321`.
   >
   > If you want to disable proxy detection entirely and always connect directly, set the property to `-Djba.http.proxy=direct`.

## Access to JetBrains Account: Troubleshooting﻿

If you encounter problems when attempting to log in to your JetBrains Account, this may be due to one of the following reasons:

### No free ports﻿



### Unable to open JetBrains Account in your browser﻿



### No access to JetBrains Account﻿



### Log in with an authorization token﻿

An authorization token is a way to log in to your JetBrains Account if your system doesn't allow for redirection from the IDE directly, for example, due to your company's security policy. GoLand recognizes when redirection to the JetBrains Account website is impossible. It enables you to copy a link to generate an authorization token manually.

1. Click Copy link and open the copied link in your browser.

   ![Copy the link to get an authorization token](Register_img/go_EAP_auth_token_login.png)

2. Log in to your JetBrains Account to generate an authorization token. After that, copy the token, paste it to the IDE authorization token field and click Check token. Once you've successfully logged in, you can start using GoLand.
