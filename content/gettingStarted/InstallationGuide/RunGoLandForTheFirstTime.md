# Run GoLand for the first time﻿

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/run-for-the-first-time.html#start-project

Last modified: 22 March 2023

You can use the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/installation-guide.html#toolbox) to run any JetBrains product. In case of a [standalone installation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/installation-guide.html#standalone), running GoLand depends on the operating system:



Windows

macOS

Linux





To run GoLand, find it in the Windows Start menu or use the desktop shortcut. You can also run the launcher batch script or executable in the installation directory under **bin**.

Once you launch GoLand, you will see the Welcome screen, the starting point to your work with the IDE, and configuring its settings. This screen also appears when you close all opened projects. Use the tabs on the left side to switch to the specific welcome dialog.

If you are a new user who has not yet created any projects, GoLand will advise you to go through an onboarding tour.

## Customize the IDE appearance﻿

Click Customize and select another [color theme](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/user-interface-themes.html) or select the Sync with OS checkbox to use your system default theme. Here you can also configure [accessibility settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/accessibility.html#red_green_deficiency) or select another [keymap](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html).

## Configure the default settings﻿

Click Customize and select Import Settings if you already have a [copy of the required settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#import-export-settings) that you want to apply.

Alternatively, click All settings to open the settings dialog. The settings that you modify at this moment will become the new default configuration for your projects and the IDE.
